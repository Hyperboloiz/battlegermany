    "In Düsseldorf, Germany we have been running two commercially successful bubble tea stores for more than ten years. Düsseldorf is one of the biggest city of Germany and the japanese center amongst german cities and is hosting a large varieties of japanese companies, intitutions and a big japanese population. In the recent decade Chinese and Koreans have been inhabitating this german city with great atmosphere of asian culture. That explains partially the reason why our bubble tea stores are popular. Meanwhile it should be pointed out that the majority of customers are still german, mostly young generation of german and children. "
